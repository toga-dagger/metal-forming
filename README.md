# metal-forming
This project aims to create programs to provide an analysis of the mechanics of bulk metal forming processes. The work carried out so far simulates the processes of wire and bar drawing, open die forward extrusion and open die forging. Here, certain sets of inputs required for the program to run have been characterised, with the output presenting the limitations of these processes, ultimately giving the user the overall feasibility of performing the operation. Analytical modelling of the aforementioned processes has been carried out on the MathWorks MATLAB which can be accessed using GUIs created using MATLAB App Designer.
